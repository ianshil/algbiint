# Bi-intuitionistic logics through the abstract algebraic logic lens

This project formalises the results in abstract algebraic logic for bi-intuitionistic logics.

## Building

Compiling the project requires Coq version 8.20.0 and may not compile on other versions. One may enforce this locally by running `opam pin coq 8.20.0` in the project folder.

## Instruction
